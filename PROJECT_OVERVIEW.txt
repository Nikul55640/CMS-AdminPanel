Project: CMS-AdminPanel
Location: workspace root

High-level Overview
- Project Type: A Content Management System (CMS) with a Node.js + Express backend and a React frontend (Vite).
- Repo Layout: Two main folders: `backend2/` (server API) and `frontend2/` (React admin + public app).
- Purpose: Provide an admin interface to manage pages, menus, components, blog posts, settings and custom content; expose API endpoints for admin and public usage.

Backend (summary)
- Entry & Config
  - `backend2/index.js` — Express app entrypoint (starts server, mounts routes, middleware).
  - `backend2/config/config.json` and `backend2/conf/env.js` — DB and environment configuration.
- Database
  - `backend2/db/sequelize.js` and `backend2/db/index.js` — Sequelize initialization and connection helpers.
  - `backend2/migrations/` — database schema migrations (blog, menus, customcontents, etc.).
  - `backend2/seeders/` and `backend2/seed.js` / `sync-db.js` — seeding scripts to pre-populate data.
- Models
  - `backend2/models/` — Sequelize models: `user.model.js`, `menu.model.js`, `page.model.js`, `blog.model.js`, `component.model.js`, `settings.model.js`, `custommenu.model.js`.
- Controllers & Routes
  - `backend2/controllers/` — controllers that implement business logic and CRUD for each resource.
  - `backend2/routes/` — Express route files that wire HTTP endpoints to controllers (auth, blog, content, menu, page, settings, component).
- Middleware & Utilities
  - `backend2/middleware/auth.middleware.js` — authentication/authorization checks.
  - `backend2/middleware/upload.js` — file upload handling.
  - `backend2/utils/ApiHelpers.js` — helpers for API responses and error handling.
- How it runs (typical flow)
  - Frontend sends HTTP requests to backend API routes.
  - Controllers interact with Sequelize models to read/write DB.
  - Middleware handles auth, uploads and request validation.
  - Migrations manage schema changes; seeders populate initial data.

Frontend (summary)
- Project Type: React app built with Vite, located in `frontend2/`.
- Entrypoint
  - `frontend2/src/main.jsx` and `frontend2/src/App.jsx` — bootstrap the app and routes.
- Pages & Routing
  - `frontend2/src/Pages/` — admin pages and public pages. Example files: `AddBlog.jsx`, `Footermenu.jsx` (edit footer menus), other admin pages.
- Components
  - `frontend2/src/components/` — UI components: `Navbar.jsx`, `ImageUploader.jsx`, tiptap editor related components.
  - `frontend2/src/componentsPublic/` — public components like `Footerpages.jsx`, `Navbarpages.jsx`, `PublicBlogList.jsx`, `PublicPage.jsx`.
- State & Context
  - `frontend2/src/context/CmsContext.jsx` — central app context (auth, settings, API base URL).
- Hooks & Utilities
  - `frontend2/src/hooks/` — custom hooks for UI/behavior.
  - `frontend2/src/lib/` — utility modules (e.g., `tiptap-utils.js`, `uploadthing.js`, `utils.js`).
- How it works (typical flow)
  - Admin logs in via `auth` endpoints.
  - Admin pages use API endpoints for CRUD operations on content, menus, blogs, pages, and settings.
  - Rich text editing uses tiptap integrations.
  - Image uploads use either backend upload endpoints or utilities in `src/lib/`.

Key Files and Their Roles
- `backend2/index.js`: server bootstrap, mounts routes and middleware.
- `backend2/controllers/*.controller.js`: implement API logic for resources.
- `backend2/models/*.model.js`: Sequelize model definitions and associations.
- `backend2/migrations/*.js`: database schema changes tracked over time.
- `frontend2/src/Pages/Footermenu.jsx`: admin UI for creating/editing footer menus (your current file).
- `frontend2/src/context/CmsContext.jsx`: global context provider for auth and app settings.
- `frontend2/src/components/ImageUploader.jsx`: UI to upload images used in pages/blogs/components.

How to run (typical steps)
- Backend (from `backend2/`):
  - Inspect `backend2/package.json` for scripts.
  - Install deps and run migrations/seeders:

    npm install
    # run migrations (may use sequelize CLI or package script)
    # run seed script if available
    node index.js  # or `npm start` depending on scripts

  - Ensure environment variables for DB, JWT secret and port are set (check `conf/env.js` or `config/config.json`).

- Frontend (from `frontend2/`):
  - Install deps and run Vite dev server:

    npm install
    npm run dev

  - Confirm the frontend's API base URL is configured in `CmsContext.jsx` or env variables and that CORS is allowed on the backend.

Common places to inspect for integration
- API base URL: `frontend2/src/context/CmsContext.jsx` or environment files.
- DB credentials: `backend2/config/config.json` or `backend2/conf/env.js`.
- Upload destination: `backend2/middleware/upload.js` and `frontend2/src/lib/uploadthing.js`.

Suggested Improvements
- Add a top-level `README.md` with quick start instructions (both backend and frontend).
- Add `dev:all` script to run frontend + backend together (e.g., with `concurrently`).
- Document migrations/seeders and make seeding idempotent.
- Add basic tests for critical controllers and a smoke test for the React app.

Next steps I can take (tell me which):
- Create a `README.md` with exact commands and env examples.
- Explain any specific file in detail (e.g., `Footermenu.jsx`, `menu.controller.js`).
- Run a quick check of `package.json` files to list exact scripts and dependencies.
